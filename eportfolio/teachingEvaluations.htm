               <li>Dr.Parker was absolutely fantastic to work with. I really appreciated that he was readily available both in and out of the classroom, and willing to provide mentorship on top of instruction. I find it hard to realistically expect to have another professor of his caliber in the future, and I am beyond glad that I was able to take INFO 4407 with him.</li>
               <li>He is a great professor who wants the best for the student. Always available when you need help to understand any concept in the class.</li>
			   <li>Professor Parker has been one of the best Professors I've ever had at ISU. Even through the zoom class, I could tell he knew his stuff and cared about his students a lot. He would make jokes during the meetings to make sure we were all engaged, and really made his class a fun one, even though it was through zoom. He was available for help outside of class, and worked hard to make sure we understood the material. I really appreciated all the work he did to make our class both enjoyable, and a place to learn. I really appreciated how willing he was to work with his students. Overall an amazing professor that I would love to take another class from.</li>
               <li>At the beginning of the course, I was not looking forward to database design. I thought it would be a boring subject that I wouldn't care for. Professor Parker did a phenomenal job of making the topics interesting and explaining just how important databases are. I remember one weekend I went home and was mentioning some of the things we'd been learning to my dad, and I found out he actually works in depth with data bases for his job. We were able to have a really good conversation about it thanks to what I'd learned from Professor Parker. He has been an amazing professor, and I wish I could take another class from him next semester.</li>
               <li>I really appreciated that there was a full-term project that involved group work. It was very nice to be able to implement the coursework into a real-world project, and directly experience the outcome.</li>
			   <li>I loved the videos and he was very engaging in person. He helped our group a lot! I learned so much about SQL and have an interest in databases now! The mini quizzes were also super useful to practice for the exams.</li>
               <li style="display:none;">I like how he never treated me like I was dumb, even though I'm a woman. :) I really appreciated it! Thank you.</li>

               <li>I think the group project was one of the best things about this course. It was a great way to connect what we were learning in class with more of a real-world example. It really helped furthered my understanding of concepts and their practical applications. I also think that having a standardized version of the database that everyone was operating on was great: it made sure we were all on the same page, and kept us from making some design/implementation mistakes.</li>
               <li>The group project and how it made us apply the concepts in class.</li>
			   <li>I appreciated the teacher’s personality and humor, and his love for the subject matter. It made what could have been grueling lectures more interesting, enjoyable, and effective.</li>
               <li>By having quizzes due each week, I was motivated to watch the lectures and study for them. By the same measure, I was motivated to work on the project each week with my team in order to meet the weekly project deliverables.</li>
               <li>I feel like the teacher genuinely cares about his students' success, and was very responsive to, and encouraging of, questions via email.</li>
               <li>Both the teacher and the course were awesome, I’d recommend them to anybody.</li>
               <li>I think the professor was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and also understanding of difficulties during these difficult times. I appreciated his dedication and patience for setbacks.</li>

               <li>This course makes a good MIS capstone, bringing together aspects of most of my previous courses. I liked his availability and understanding when difficulties and problems arose.</li>
               <li>He encouraged questions or discussions during class or after class. The course was very helpful.</li>
               <li>I like his availability and his ability to keep the class interesting and relevant to the student.</li>

               <li>The presentations are a good exercise for real-world business presentation. More internet surfing was needed to work on projects, which is good.</li>
               <li>I learned something from preparing the presentation.</li>
               <li>This course provided good background on the subject to help me as a manager at work. Good concern for students, fair, easy to listen to.</li>
               <li>I appreciated the teacher's depth of knowledge on the subject and also his enthusiasm.</li>
               <li>It was great to be up-to-date on new technology. I used a lot of what I learned at work.</li>
               <li>I appreciated the opportunity to research and build a lecture.</li>
               <li>Very nice and cared about the progress of his students.</li>
               <li>Dr. Parker has a fantastic attitude towards teaching. His demeanor is down-to-earth and non-hypocritical, non-authoritative.</li>
               <li>Dr. Parker gave us an open way to do presentations. He always has time to see the students. He is a good teacher.</li>
               <li>I was a computer idiot before I take this course. Now I am not anymore. From an idiot to a knowledgeable person, the process does work.</li>
               <li>Dr. Parker is the most enthusiastic professor. The way he pushes students to study works really very well. Compare with other business class, this class is worth me to pay $1,500 tuition. And he always encourages students to ask questions. He always welcomes students to have different opinions. As a student, you don't have to worry about saying something. The best thing in his class is “have fun to study”.</li>

               <li>I felt that the style that Dr. Parker taught was quite effective. The handouts of the notes before our lectures helped us understand the material better because we can concentrate on what he said, instead of writing Dr. Parker was extremely open to our suggestions concerning more effective ways of teaching.</li>
               <li>The instructor shows knowledge and enthusiasm when in class, and very open to help outside of class.</li>

               <li>I liked receiving the notes at the beginning of each class. It helped me be able to listen to what was being presented rather than trying to copy down everything.</li>

               <li>Very good style and effectiveness. Dr. Parker was always willing and able to explain a difficult concept in an understandable manner. I wish I had more professors like him.</li>

            <h4>Email Comments:</h4>
            <p>Thank you, Dr. Parker,</p>
            <p>You have been a great teacher, and I consider you a personal friend.  I appreciate that 
            you expect your students to stretch, search, and apply what is taught in class. Of course, 
            that can make assignments more difficult, but I have paid a lot of money for my education, 
            and expect to actually learn something. I become irritated when a class becomes nothing 
            more that a hoop or monkey-see-monkey-do.</p>
            <p>Graduating has filled me with mixed emotions. I am excited to move on to graduate school 
            (assuming that I am accepted), but I am also sad to leave all of the friends that I have 
            made along the way. I will never forget the kindness and genuine concern that you have 
            shown me over the years. Thank you so much, and best wishes to you and your family.</p>

            <p>Dr. Parker -</p> 
            <p>I just wanted to compliment the 
            quality of your course. I have since transferred to another university where I am currently 
            enrolled in an information system course with elements of Web Design and I am leaps and 
            bounds ahead of all of the other students because of the content of your course. I am 
            easily able to create web pages with JavaScript to the amazement of my peers. I 
            specifically compliment your projects/assignments. Even though they were at times hard, 
            I learned the most from them and know that your teaching style, though challenging, has 
            been very beneficial to me.</p>
            <p>Thanks</p>

            <p>You will always be one of the great people I'll think about from ISU. I wish all my 
            professors cared as much about me really learning as you did. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I just wanted to thank you very much for everything you've done for me at ISU. I 
            appreciate you, and I probably will even more as I enter the job market. I appreciate 
            everything I have learned and I feel very confident in my skills.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to sincerely thank you for all your help with our project (especially 
            tonight when we were keeping you from your dinner). As much as that project really SUCKED 
            (and it really did suck at times) I really did learn a whole lot. Our group was grrrreat, 
            I made three really good friends out of the whole thing (it's amazing how well you can bond 
            over DFDs and HTML at 2am in the morning). It's weird to think that I didn't even know 
            Katie and Becky before this semester, and now I don't think I'll be able to take another 
            MIS class without them. Anyway – I just wanted to really thank you and let you know that 
            I have enjoyed your class this semester (and I am not trying to suck up either). I really 
            mean it.</p>
            <p>Thanks Again!</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for being a dedicated teacher and a great guy. I'm sure all the skills 
            I have learned in the MIS curriculum will help me in my job at AT&amp;T Solutions out 
            east. Thanks again!</p>

            <p>I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk and help me through this 
            project. I have had my share of professors that just didn't care and never wanted 
            to help out.</p>

            <p>In my opinion you are one of the few teachers that care about his students. I

            the opinion of a majority of us.</p>

            <p>It has genuinely been a pleasure being taught by you. The most I have taken away from 
            the MIS program has been from your classes. Your classes were harder than hell but I ended 
            up learning a lot from them. You are truly an asset to the MIS program at SLU. This e-mail 
            is in a way thanking you for all the hard work you put in teaching these classes and giving 
            you a pat on your back. Keep on teaching.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to drop you a quick email to let you know that everything you taught us 
            in SAD is right on. Not that I ever doubted you...just that the real world is hard to 
            imagine after 16 years of constant schooling. I just got back from training with Arthur 
            Andersen and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I already knew, even as a snot-nosed 
            rookie.</p>

            <p>Hi, I wanted to thank you for having the impact you did on my future. Your classes 
            were the deciding factor if I was going to be an MIS major or not. I liked C, but never 
            thought I would be able to major in the whole MIS thing cuz I did not understand very 
            much. I also remember buying the books for your classes and thinking it was probably the 
            biggest waste of money since I would drop the classes and have to figure out a new major 
            (talk about self-confidence). But, anyways, I know sometimes all the teacher hears is the 
            crabbing about the quizzes, programs, homework, and tests they give (sounds familiar), but 
            I just wanted to tell you that I appreciated everything you have done for me in the past.</p>

            <p>Well, it is all over. I finally graduated. I just wanted to say thanks
            for being a wonderful teacher. I enjoyed being in your classes and all.
            You and your classes are what made me decide that I wanted to major in
            MIS. Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.</p>

            <p>I wanted to tell you that everything that you said was true about using the stuff we 
            learned in the MIS classes at SLU. I have already, in the first two weeks, encountered 
            data flow diagrams, task flow diagrams, flowcharts, normalization, and just about 
            everything else that you clowns in the DEPARTMENT taught me. Basically I just wanted to 
            be added to the list of people to tell you that you were right.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to take this chance to say thanks for everything! It has been great having 
            you as a teacher and I really learned a lot in your classes. Most of all, it has been really 
            nice as a student to have a teacher that really seems to care about his students and their 
            futures. It really means a lot.</p>

            <p>I just recently took a job as a software engineer doing database work. I work on an 
            ORACLE based product doing customer customizations and use much of the education I 
            obtained in your database class. I truly enjoyed your class, as well as your teaching 
            style. It had a great influence over me, and has helped me to obtain and enjoy the 
            position I have now. I guess what I'm trying to say is thanks. You've given me much 
            and I appreciate that.</p>

            <p>You told us that you appreciated the hard work that our class did this semester. I 
            would like to express to you my appreciation for the dedication that you put into the 
            MIS program. Thinking of the evaluation you told us that one of your past students wrote 
            for you, I would like to say that if you are indicative of the rest of the professors in 
            the MIS department, then I am damn proud of graduating from it!</p>

            <p>I wanted to thank you. Not to be sappy, but you really are a great teacher. You 
            get the students excited about what they are learning and how they are learning it. And 
            you teach them stuff that actually applies to the business world.</p>
