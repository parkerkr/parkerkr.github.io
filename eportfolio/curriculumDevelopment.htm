             <p class="bold">Idaho State University</p>
             <p>One of my first tasks after becoming department chair was leading the effort to 
             update our curriculum. We first transitioned the Computer Information Systems (CIS) 
             program to Business Informatics, closely followed by converting Health Information 
             Systems Management to Health Informatics. Both majors were redesigned to better serve both 
             the students and employers. </p>
             <p>The next phase undertaken by our team was the design of a Master of Science in Health 
             Informatics curriculum. This was eventually followed by the development of a concurrent 
             BBA and MS degree to permit students to attain both the BBA and MS in Health Informatics 
             in five years.</p>
             <p>Our faculty also assisted in developing a proposal for a Master of Science in Data Analytics, 
             and a Master of Science in Computer Science.</p>
             <p>Several years prior to becoming chair, I was instrumental in the restructuring of the 
             undergraduate CIS curriculum, and participated in the development of a proposal for a 
             Master’s program in CIS.</p>

             <p>I also proposed and developed, or redesigned, dozens of courses as follows:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Course Redesign: INFO 3307 – Systems Analysis and Design was restructured to include 
                classincal analysis and design techiques, object-oriented analysis and design techniques, and 
                the anaylsis and design of web-based systems, including a glimpse of web engineering and web 
                science (Fall 2016)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 1120 – The original CIS 1120 was split into two courses. The second component, which will remain CIS 
                1120, will focus on client-side programming using JavaScript and jQuery. (Fall 2012)</li>
                <li>New Course: CIS 1110 – The original CIS 1120 was split into two courses. This new course delves 
                more deeply into HTML5 and CSS3. While JavaScript and interactive pages will be introduced, those 
                concepts are no longer the focus of the course. This new focus, and the fact that HTML5 and CSS3 
                will not be finalized for several years, required course materials to be developed from the ground 
                up. (Spring 2012).</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 4430 – Developed an entirely new set of course materials for the Web Development 
                for eCommerce course. Previously the course delivery was student driven, with course topics selected by 
                the professor, but lectures were researched and presented by the students as a means of developing 
                student research and presentation skills. However, presentation quality had degraded over the years, 
                necessitating a new delivery model. A set of course lectures and assignments were researched and developed 
                by the professor. In addition, the use of MySQL and PHP to generate actual online catalog pages for 
                fully-functioning eCommerce sites was incorporated into the course. The emphasis on web entrepreneurship 
                was increased. (Fall 2011)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 4403 – Redesigned Systems Analysis and Design to bring course content up to date and to 
                introduce a focus on the development of web-based information systems. Topics like agile development 
                and cloud based computing were also added to course. All course materials, including lectures, assignments, 
                and exams were developed from the ground up. (Fall 2011)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 4407 – Redesigned the database course so that it was based on MySQL rather 
                than SQL Server. This was done to integrate the course more fully with CIS 4430 (Web Development for
                eCommerce) as part of a thrust toward web entrepreneurship. Database manipulation using PHP was also introduced in 
                the course, as was installation and use of the LAMP or WAMP web development frameworks. Almost all new 
                course materials were researched and developed for this course. (Spring 2011)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CS 2282 – Modified Advanced Computer Programming for the Computer Science department 
                to expand the coverage of object-oriented concepts and to introduce the C#.Net programming language into the curriculum. 
                All new course materials were researched and developed for this course. (Fall 2010)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 3302 – Revised our Information Systems course to introduce the use of open source tools to teach 
                students to develop a fully functional web site for a real or prototype business. This course is an introduction to IS for 
                most non-majors, and students learned to appreciate the utility of IS when they develop something that they find useful and 
                intriguing. At the same time, students see how information systems are interwoven throughout a successful business. 
                All new course materials were researched and developed for this course.(Spring 2010)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 2220 – Redesigned the Foundations of Computer Programming course to 
                incorporate some of object-oriented concepts that had previously been covered in CIS 3320, since CIS 
                3320 was removed from the list of required courses. (Fall 2008)</li>
                <li>New Course: CIS 1120 (initially CIS 2299) – Designed and developed Interactive Web Development 
                to provide students with exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as to help students acquire basic 
                programming skills. This course in effect replaced our existing introduction to programming course and was 
                intended to use interactive web development to gently introduce both majors and non-majors to programming 
                concepts like sequence, selection, and iteration, as well as functions, parameters, arrays, and string 
                manipulation. All new course materials were researched and developed for this course. (Spring 2008)</li>
                <li>New Course: CIS 5591 – Developed a graduate seminar called CS/CIS Graduate Technology Seminar at 
                the request of the GIS program for research-oriented graduates with an interest in new advances in computing 
                technology. The seminar is based on analysis of articles from recent literature on emerging technology as well as 
                new topics and challenges in software development, deployment, and use. All new course materials were 
                researched and developed for this course. (Fall 2007)</li>
                <li>New Course: CIS 4407 – Developed Database Design and Implementation to replace our existing database course. 
                This course incorporates a professional-grade multi-user relational DBMS (SQL Server) and covers advanced topics like 
                stored procedures and triggers, advanced SQL, query optimization, and information assurance. Preprogrammed SQL using ASP.NET or 
                VB.NET is included. All new course materials were researched and developed for this course.(Spring 2006)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 4430 – Revised our Web Development for eCommerce to incorporate emerging web development technologies 
                like Web 2.0, HTML 4.01, AJAX, XBRL, etc., as well as topics like PHP, MySQL, and ASP.Net that are not covered in other courses. (Fall 
                2004)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 3382 – Revised Systems Analysis and Design to emphasize the systems development life cycle. Structured design approaches 
                such as data flow diagrams are compared and contrasted to newer approaches associated with the unified modeling language (UML) to model systems. 
                All new course materials were researched and developed for this course. This course was later replaced by CIS 4403. (Spring 2003)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 3320 – Revised Advanced Business Programming (originally CIS 2221), to emphasize 
                critical advanced topics, including object-oriented concepts and introductory data structures. Later course 
                revisions de-emphasized data structures to expand coverage of OO concepts. All new course materials were 
                researched and developed for this course. A semester project using .NET was developed and refined for this course, and was eventually published in 
                an academic journal. (Spring 2002)</li>
                <li>New Course: CIS 4440 – Designed and developed Object-Oriented Programming to provide students with experience using the Java 
                programming language and to provide thorough coverage of all object-oriented design concepts. All new course 
                materials were researched and developed for this course. This course was originally listed 
                as CIS 4491. (Fall 2000)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 4480 – Revised Database Management Systems to more thoroughly cover basic database concepts including 
                database design techniques such as data modeling and normalization. Students design database systems, implement them, and access them 
                using SQL queries, forms, and reports. All new course materials were researched and developed for 
                this course. While teaching this class I developed a variety of "life-like" semester projects, two of which 
                (Teton White Water Kayak and Lost River Wind Riders) were published in academic journals. I also formulated a data model validation 
                approach for relational database design courses that was also published. (Fall 1999)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: CIS 2200 – Revised Foundations of Computer Programming from the ground up to increase student engagement and 
                retention, and to use an object-based language to better teach students the basics of programming including the essential concepts of sequence, 
                selection, and iteration, as well as procedures, arrays, and string manipulation through the use of the Visual Basic.Net programming 
                language. Problem solving techniques and analytical thinking are also emphasized. All new course materials were researched 
                and developed for this course. (Fall 1999)</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
             <p class="bold">Saint Louis University</p>
             <p>While at SLU, I helped to direct multiple restructurings of the 
             undergraduate MIS curriculum, and contributed to the development of 
             a new Master of Science in MIS program.</p>
             <p>I also proposed and developed, or redesigned, several courses as follows:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>New Course: MIS 345 – Collaborated on the development of Advanced Internet Technologies with an adjunct instructor. This course 
                was designed to provide students with knowledge of the components of a web-based business/storefront and how to apply the components to an 
                intranet or extranet, as well as the programming capability to implement such a solution. The primary infrastructure components 
                include HTML, web serving, network programming, servlets, and Java Database Connectivity. (Fall 1998)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: MIS 320 – Revised Object-Oriented Programming to enhance OO coverage and to introduce the Java language. This course 
                predated and anticipated industry movement to Java. Since course content changed completely, this course was developed from the ground up as an 
                essentially new course. (Fall 1996)</li>
                <li>New Course: MIS 600 – Designed and developed a new graduate course called Managing Information Technology and Emerging Technologies 
                that explored new technologies and their potential use in and impact on business. This course provided students with a broad-based understanding 
                of the management of information  technology in order to prepare them to manage change as the technology is implemented in the organizational 
                environment. It also made students aware of current technological issues and how they impact his or her ability to manage. 
                All new course materials were researched and developed for this course. (Spring 1996)</li>
                <li>Course Redesisgn: MIS 410 – Revised Systems Analysis and Design to increase student engagement and to emphasize the systems development 
                life cycle. Data flow diagrams are used to model processes. All new course materials were researched and 
                developed for this course. (Spring 1996)</li>
                <li>Course Redesign: MIS 430 – Revised Database Management Systems to more thoroughly cover basic database concepts including database design 
                techniques such as data modeling using entity-relationship diagrams as well as normalization. Students design database systems, implement them using 
                Oracle, and access them using SQL queries, forms, and reports. All new course materials were researched and 
                developed for this course. (Fall 1995)</li>
             </ul>
