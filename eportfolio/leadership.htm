                  Leadership Philosophy

                     <p style="margin-top:.5em;">Leadership involves more than carrying out administrative 
                     duties like planning, assessing, monitoring, coordinating, hiring, firing, etc. 
                     A leader is responsible for leading people. An academic leader's responsibilities 
                     subsume both leadership and administration.</p>
                     
                     <p>Here are some traits that I consider vital to a leader:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Supportive</b>: An academic leader must advocate for their College and faculty, even while supporting students, their administrative superiors, and other stakeholders.</li>
                        <li><b>Stakeholder-oriented</b>: Administrators are the primary spokespersons for their faculty, staff, and students. They are responsible for implementing policies for central administration.</li>
                        <li><b>Progressive</b>: A leader must be forward-thinking, proactive, innovative, and willing to embrace change. While this is demanded of all leaders, it is especially critical to a leader in any technology-driven discipline.</li>
                        <li><b>Decisive</b>: While it is critical to gather as many facts as possible before making decision, it is vital to be able to make a decision.</li>
                        <li><b>Transformational</b>: A leader must lead faculty through change by identifying where changes needed to be made and then moving the department in the corresponding direction.</li>
  			            <li><b>Collaborative</b>: Academic leaders must embrace shared governance. Whenever possible faculty should be involved in the decision-making process. A leader should work toward establishing a consensus whenever possible, but avoid leading by consensus. A leader should not be afraid to rely on others for help and must be willing to delegate.</li>
                        <li><b>Fair</b>: All faculty members should be treated equitably and, whenever possible, equally. While it is vital to recognize faculty achievements or service, no faculty member should ever feel marginalized. A leader should never give special treatment in exchange for support.</li>
                        <li><b>Considerate</b>: A leader should treat others with consideration. A leader should act as a mentor and set a good example, listen and respond thoughtfully to people's concerns, rely on the wisdom and experience of others, and care about those with whom he or she works.</li>
  			            <li><b>Receptive</b>: A leader must be willing to listen to honest feedback. Leaders who surround themselves with "yes men" do themselves a disservice. Every leader needs people who are not afraid to call attention to ill-advised decisions. A successful leader must be honest, fair, and open to new ideas, and must realize that he or she isn't always right.</li>
                        <li><b>Transparent</b>: While a leader must take into account a multitude of political, financial, and environmental factors when making any decision, he or she should share facts and constraints with faculty whenever possible.</li>
                     </ul>

                  <p style="margin-top:.5em;">The following is a list of leadership aspects to which I aspire*.</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li><b>Excellence</b>: Exemplifies excellence, and expects it in students, faculty, and staff.</li>
                     <li><b>Creative and daring</b>: Thinks and acts innovatively, as befits a proactive school.</li>
                     <li><b>Morale Boosting</b>: Avoids a culture of negativity; cultivates enthusiastic, constructive 
                     engagement and collaboration – a fun and lively place of learning.</li>
                     <li><b>Principled</b>: Works with openness, fairness, and integrity, and strives to earn the trust of 
                     those who report to her/him, and those to whom s/he reports.</li>
                     <li><b>Responsible</b>: Accepts responsibility for hard decisions, placing student success and the 
                     university's core values ahead of personal and political loyalties.</li>
                     <li><b>Inquisitive</b>: Embraces transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, visionary, and experiential 
                     approaches to teaching and learning.</li>
                     <li><b>Cosmopolitan</b>: Encourages and seeks diversity and pluralism along many dimensions.</li>
                     <li><b>Managerial</b>: Has experience with the intricacies of administration, delegating 
                     where appropriate, but informed on processes and procedures.</li>
                     <li><b>Ambassadorial</b>: Can represent the department, college, and university to external 
                     stakeholders in a way that is accurate and engaging.</li>
                     <li><b>Encouraging</b>: Acknowledges the importance of professional growth in his/her own administrative 
                     role, and supports and encourages it for faculty and staff as well.</li>
                  </ul>

                        Having previously served as the Chair of the Department of Computer Information 
                        Systems, I became chair of the Department of Informatics and Computer Science 
                        when it was formed in 2013 from the strategic alliance between the CIS department 
                        in the College of Business and the Computer Science program in the College of 
                        Science and Engineering.

                     <p>
                        The Department of Informatics and Computer Science is housed jointly within the 
                        ISU College of Business and the College of Science and Engineering, and faculty 
                        report to their original college through the chair. As department chair I report 
                        to both college deans, with the dean of the College of Business taking the lead.

                     <p>
                        The Computer Science faculty consists of the program coordinator, two  professors 
                        who, prior to the program consolidation, held joint appointments in both Computer 
                        Science and Computer Information Systems, two new hires with exceptional qualifications, 
                        and two additional faculty lines that will be affiliated with the Polytechnic on 
                        our Idaho Falls campus.

                           <p>Dr. Parker is a bright spot here at ISU and is a model for a department chair.</p>

                           <p>Dr. Parker is a valued member of the College of Business leadership team, as well as a productive researcher and solid teacher.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Parker published two peer-reviewed publications in 2018 and has several projects in progress; given his administrative duties, his research output exceeds expectations.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Parker's administrative duties and leadership are also beyond what one would expect. His department spans two colleges, and as such, he attends chair and/or executive committee meetings for both the College of Business and the College of Science and Engineering. His search committee work load has been especially heavy in 2018, with searches for two computer science positions, an informatics position, and five faculty members in the Polytechnic cluster hire. He also mentors our new faculty.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Parker will complete his sixth year as Chair of Informatics and Computer Science ﴾ICS﴿. Dr. Parker’s department straddles the College of Business and the College of Science and Engineering. While the department is currently small in size with only six faculty total, it is growing and aligned with the Polytechnic in Idaho Falls. That said, Dr. Parker currently has the traditional 9-month appointment of a regular faculty member.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Parker’s annual activity report gives convincing evidence that he is an energetic colleague who performs all components of his job with considerable skill and insight. The Dean is particularly grateful for his deft handling of a particularly difficult personnel issue, the resolution of which placed additional workload on Kevin. I also appreciate his interest in and service to the Polytechnic. Kevin’s involvement with and mentoring of new faculty along with the re-shaping of the CS curriculum is both timely and wise. Moreover, his mentoring of new faculty and interest in the long term development of his department augurs well for the continued growth and stability of the CS program. I consider Kevin’s input to be invaluable to CoSE as we build a meaningful teaching and research presence in Computer Science.</p>

                           <p><span class="bold">Performance is Exceptional</span> (denotes extraordinary performance that is well beyond that expected of faculty member relative to current faculty rank and position description)</p>
                           <p>Dr. Parker oversees the undergraduate programs in business informatics and health informatics, as well as the graduate program in health informatics.  I addition, he oversees the computer science program, a program jointly administered with the College of Science and Engineering.  Yet, despite this significant administrative burden, he has maintained an outstanding level of scholarly productivity and, as always, excelled in the classroom.  For these reasons, I disagree with Dr. Parker’s self-rating and assign a rating of "Performance is Exceptional."</p>

                           <p>Dr. Parker has assigned himself a rating of “Performance is Above Expectations.”  I disagree.  For more than a decade Dr. Parker has consistently maintained a rating on student evaluations that place him at or near the top of the faculty in the College of Business.  He has done this while maintaining very rigorous standards in his classes.  In addition, due to personnel and staffing problems within the Department of Computer Information Systems, Dr. Parker has nearly single-handedly delivered the entire curriculum for approximately one hundred CIS majors.  If this wasn’t burdensome enough, Dr. Parker tirelessly support new initiatives, rapidly evolving curriculum, and supports the College whenever and wherever he can.  For these reasons the College of Business is deeply appreciative and indebted to Dr. Parker.  I assign him an Annual Evaluation rating of "Performance is Exceptional."</p>
